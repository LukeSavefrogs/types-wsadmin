# FAQ

## Package
### Does this package let me interact with Websphere Application Server?
**No**, this package only provides autocompletion and intellisense functionality, as well as an online manual complete with examples.
### Do I need the same Python version of the `wsadmin`?
**No**, to work this package needs **Python >3.7**. However, the syntax of your scripts should match the Pyhon version run by the `wsadmin` Jython interpreter.
