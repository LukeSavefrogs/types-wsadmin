# `types-wsadmin`
Python type stubs for `wsadmin` Jython commands.

## Disclaimer

This projects uses type hints, which were introduced in **Python 3.5**, so ensure you're using a supported version of python.

From the [Python Stubs](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/stubs.html) documentation:
> Type stubs are syntactically valid Python 3.7 files with a .pyi suffix. The Python syntax used for type stubs is independent from the Python versions supported by the implementation, and from the Python version the type checker runs under (if any). Therefore, type stub authors should use the latest available syntax features in stubs (up to Python 3.7), even if the implementation supports older, pre-3.7 Python versions.
